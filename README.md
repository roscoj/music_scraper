# music_scraper

This program is designed to be uploaded to the cloud and be utilised on an automated basis.
The program creates periodic CSV files of scraped information based on location (via postcode) and radius to location.

## In Development

1. Change naming convention of CSV files
2. Create a CSV comparison module that takes CSV files, compares them and returns the non-duplicated entries. This allows for new users to be found per running of the scrape
3. Email the non-duplicated CSV file to an email address
